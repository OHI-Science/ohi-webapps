As you begin a regional assessment, it is important to become familiar with your study area's web-based Toolbox Application (a **Web Application**, or **WebApp**). This will be the organizational structure and data template for your assessment.

# Data page

The Toolbox WebApp will be on the **Data page** upon loading and will look like this:

![example: **[ohi-science.shinyapps.io/ecuador](https://ohi-science.shinyapps.io/ecuador/)**](./fig/webapps1.png)  

The *Map* tab shows the study area with subcountry regions (as identified by [gadm.org](www.gadm.org)). When you move your cursor over each region on the map, the region's name (with unique numerical identifier in parentheses) will appear in the top right corner of the map. A value will also appear, which is determined by the display options on the left (either Output Score or Input Layer). 

You may view each region as a distribution on the *Histogram* tab and numerically on the *Table* tab.  
 
## Display options
  
The left panel has several drop-down menus that indicate the information being displayed. The primary distinction is whether information is prepared data (**Input Layers**) or calculated scores (**Output Scores**). 

1. choose between Output Scores or Input Layers ('Choose variable type')
2. choose the target to display ('Choose target (index or goal)')
3. choose the output score's dimension or the input layer's data (depending on previous selections)
4. additional drop-down menus will appear, depending on previous selections 
  
Information is presented just below the drop-down menus, including a description of the score or data, with a summary of the data and a source, in the case of Data Layers. 
 
 
## Template data and scores
 
**Template data provided in your WebApp should be updated with local data when possible**.
Using local data and targets will provide a much more accurate picture of ocean health in your study area, including comparisons between subcountry regions. 
 
Data from the global assessment have been extracted for your study area and assigned to the subcountry regions within your study area, and scores have been calculated using these data. In most cases, data have been applied equally across all regions within your study area, except for some layers that were based on spatial data and were extracted individually by region. For example, compare these two input data layers:

> - `Input Layer > Mariculture > Coastal population inland 25 kilometers`

> - `Input Layer > Mariculture > Mariculture sustainability score`

and notice that *Coastal population inland 25 kilometers* has different values across all regions and *Mariculture sustainability score* has the same value across all regions. This is because of the type of the data used in the global assessment: *Coastal population inland 25 kilometers* was spatial data that could be extracted at any scale (i.e. subcountry regions) and *Mariculture sustainability score* was tabular data that has been applied equally across all regions.  

The highest priority for substituting local data for these template data should be the data layers that were applied equally across all regions. 
 
# Compare page

The **Compare page** allows you to visually track updates to data layers and scores as you modify the input layers and recalculate the scores by running the Toolbox. While not useful initially as you are just beginning your assessment, this will become very valuable to check your progress and to share with collaborators.
