# Global OHI vs. Local OHI+ Scores Comparison

OHI+ scores are calculated based on the best available local information, which is incorporated as inputs, goal models, and reference points. The purpose of OHI+ assessments is to customize the OHI framework methodology to best represent the local context being assessed, which can mean different visions of what a healthy ocean is and what it should provide. This makes OHI+ scores not directly comparable to scores calculated in the global assessments, which are based on coarser-scale information, models, and reference points. However, a table comparing scores can help identify which goal scores and therefore which methodolgies differed the most between the assessments. Because of the local information included, OHI+ assessments should be used for within-country decision making, and global scores should be used to compare global comparisons. 

View the [comparison table here](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/<%=git_repo%>/master/<%=default_scenario%>/reports/compare_scores_global_OHIplus.html), which displays **2014 global OHI scores** (for <%=name_gl_rgn_cap%>) with **<%=study_area%> OHI+ scores** and the **differences between them**. The differences are colored from blue to red, with dark blue indicating the largest positive difference and red indicating the largest negative difference.

REGIONAL ASSESSMENTS: THE KEY TO OCEAN HEALTH
 
The Ocean Health Index’s key strategy for driving ocean improvement is enlisting, encouraging and assisting countries to carry out their own regional assessments.   The rationale is that countries or sub-regions may have finer-scale data available that cannot be used in global-level assessments because other countries do not have equivalent information, but can be used to conduct their own assessments using the general framework of the Ocean Health Index, but modifying it to fit local conditions and values.  Results of such studies should be able to describe regional conditions more accurately and more usefully for local policy making, management and ocean health improvement.  By repeating such studies over time in the same region, countries will be able to track the success of measures that they take to improve aspects of ocean health.
 
Regional assessments, which are branded as OHI+, have been completed or are at various stages of discussion or development in: Chi, Colombia, Israel, Ecuador, Baltic Sea (Denmark, Estonia, the European Union, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden), Canada, Spain, Peru, Hawaii, New Caledonia, Brazil, Fiji, British Virgin Islands, South Korea, Japan, British Columbia, Pacific Oceanscape, Mexico, Gabon, U.S. West Coast, Chile, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Panama, Western Indian Ocean, Philippines, and Indonesia. 
 
As more and more countries carry out their own OHI+ studies, their combined efforts should be able to move the needle on the global Ocean Health Index scores.
 
A Website, www.ohi-science.org, has been developed to assist countries with their OHI+ assessments.  It provides all the instructions, methods, calculational tools, maps and other information needed to begin such a study.

Are scores comparable place-to-place? All results of the Ocean Health Index’s global assessments are comparable geographically (place-to-place), because all regions are assessed using the same methods and data sources.  The global assessment only employs data drawn from global-level databases in which similar data have been taken in the same manner for all regions. 
 
Countries or territories may possess finer-scale data gained from their own studies, but such data cannot be included in global-level assessments if other countries do not have equivalent information.  Countries may use such data to conduct their own regional assessment using the general framework of the Ocean Health Index, but modifying it to fit local conditions and values.  These results may be more useful for regional policy and management than the coarser results produced by the global assessment.
 
Results of regional assessments done over time (with appropriate corrections for any changes in methods) are comparable, so the region can use them to see any progress in its scores and help evaluate the success of any resilience actions taken.
 
However, the results of a regional assessment cannot be compared either with results from the global assessment or with the results of regional assessments from other places, because there is no way to gauge the extent to which differences in scores result from differences in methods or differences in conditions of ocean health.
