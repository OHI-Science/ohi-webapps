# README

These .geojson files were downloaded from all ohi-science repos using `ohi-webapps/OHI_EEZGADM_download.r` on May 27 2016 before deleting many of the unused OHI+ repos with `ohi-webapps/delete_unused_repos.r`.

Each of the `regions_gcs_*.geojson` files were made by @bbest: Exclusive economic zones (EEZs) were identified by MarineRegions.org and the largest subcountry regions were identified by the generalized administrative boundary database GADM.org. Region boundaries were extended offshore to divide the EEZ of Baltic into offshore regions.
